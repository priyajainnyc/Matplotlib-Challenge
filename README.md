# Matplotlib-Challenge
Homework 5 for the matplotlib module of Datavis bootcamp.

My Data folder contains the two CSV files I used, Mouse_metadata.csv and Study_results.csv - my script paths to these files.

A file called pymaceuticals.ipynb contains the main script to run the analysis as well as the observations and inferences.

Below are the tasks associated with this challenge.

Tasks Involved:
-	Prepare date by merging and cleaning both data sets
-	Generate summary statistics for every drug regimen
-	Create bar and pie charts to plot the total number of time points and distribution of male and female mice
-	Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot for each regimen
-	Create a line and scatter plot to get the trend of tumor volume versus time point and mouse weight for a specific treatment
-	Calculate and plot correlation and regression models between tumor volume and mouse weight for a specific treatment
